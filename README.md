- 👋 Hi, I’m Chloe Nguyen
- 🌱 I’m currently working on this cool hobby project, [Sharepolls](https://sharepolls.vercel.app/), an app to create and share polls on the web. Right now I'm doing a react-native re-write of the projects for learning purposes.
- I have previously worked on Tealium Machine Learning: https://tealium.com/products/tealium-predict-machine-learning/
- 💞️ I’m looking for front end / full stack engineer roles. 
- 📫 Reach me on github and email: chloenguyenpro@gmail.com
